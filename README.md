## Test Client for Android

Directory `test-app` is the test client. You need to modify the server host and port in the main activity to run the test correctly.

## Prototype

Directory `app` is the prototype of this paper. After the application is installed, you can connect to the server-side application by openning an VSSE url through an web browser. The VSSE url can be exported through a connected PC client. Also, you can change the url contained in the source code directly.
